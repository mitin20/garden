# Base Image

This example demonstrates how to use a base Docker image that other modules can extend. This is for example useful when you have several modules written in the same programming language that all share a similiar `Dockerfile` structure.

The example also shows how you can use different `Dockerfile`s depending on your environment. For example, when you have a development image that includes some tools or code that you don't want in your production image.

## Project Structure

The example has a `base-image` module and a single `backend` module (in a real world scenario, you might have multiple modules that all extend the same base image). The `base-image` module only contains a `Dockerfile`.

The `backend` module contains the source code and has two `Dockerfile`s, one for development and one for production. Both `Dockerfile`s extend the image from the `base-image` module, and each sets an `APP_ENV` environment variable that the `backend` returns when called.

To achieve this, we set the `base-image` as a build dependency for the `backend` module:

```yaml
# In backend/garden.yml
kind: Module
name: backend
...
build:
  dependencies: [base-image]
```

This ensures that the `base-image` is built ahead of the `backend`.

We also use [build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) in the Dockerfile and the [`garden.yml`](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types/container#buildargs) config so that the correct base image version is used:

```yaml
# In backend/garden.yml
kind: Module
name: backend
...
# The build arguments to use when building the image.
# Corresponds to the ARG directive in the Dockerfile.
buildArgs:
  BASE_IMAGE_VERSION: ${modules.base-image.version}
```

and

```Dockerfile
# In backend/Dockerfile.dev
ARG BASE_IMAGE_VERSION
FROM base-image:${BASE_IMAGE_VERSION}
ENV APP_ENV=development
```

Finally, we tell Garden to use a Dockerfile based on the environment:

```yaml
# In backend/garden.yml
kind: Module
name: backend
...
dockerfile: "${environment.name == 'prod' ? 'Dockerfile.prod' : 'Dockerfile.dev'}"
```

## Usage

Run `garden deploy` to deploy the project. It defaults to deploying the `dev` environment.

Running `garden call backend` should then return `development backend says hi!`.

If you now run `garden deploy --env prod` and call the backend with `garden call backend` you should see: `production backend says hi!`.
