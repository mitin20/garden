# conftest example

This simple example shows you how you can easily drop [conftest](https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest)Â into your project to validate your Kubernetes manifests.

The [project config](./garden.yml) contains a single line that automatically creates a `conftest` test for each `kubernetes` and `helm` module in your project:

```yaml
kind: Project
name: conftest
environments:
  - name: local
providers:
  - name: local-kubernetes
  - name: conftest-kubernetes     # <------
```

For the example, we've copied the [kubernetes example](https://github.com/instrumenta/conftest/tree/master/examples/kubernetes) from the conftest repository, and added a `helm` module type for good measure.

To test this, simply run `garden test` in this directory. You should quickly see a few tests failing because resources don't match the policies defined under the `policy` directory.

Note that you could also manually specify tests using the [conftest module type](https://docs.garden.io/reference/module-types/conftest).
